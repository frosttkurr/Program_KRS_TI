Program KRS TI is an application created to assist TI Unud students in choosing subjects each semester. This application contains every TI Unud subject, where user are given the control to choose each subject (according to applicable regulations) so that it will then be printed in the application.

Program KRS TI is a C language application that is made by I & my friend as a final project for programming subject.

# How to Use

In the main menu, users must register their NIM and name if it's not registered, if already registered, users just select login. Users will be asked to enter their semester, GPA (semester 2 and above), and concentration (semester 4-14).

For semesters 1 and 2, KRS will be printed immediately (package system). For semesters 3-14, a list of available subjects will be displayed and the user should select subjects according to the conditions that are allowed to be printed. 
Select the number of the subject list at once in one line and separated by space, end the choice by “0” and press "Enter" to stop selecting subjects.
(ex: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0)

After the conditions for the number of credits are met, the KRS will be printed on the screen and the program will stop. On the other hand, if the conditions for the number of credits are not met, an error message will be printed and the program will return to the main menu.
