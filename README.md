# How to Use

In the main menu, users must register their NIM and name if it's not registered, if already registered, users just select login. Users will be asked to enter their semester, GPA (semester 2 and above), and concentration (semester 4-14).

For semesters 1 and 2, KRS will be printed immediately (package system). For semesters 3-14, a list of available courses will be displayed and the user should select subjects according to the conditions that are allowed to be printed.

Press “0” when finished selecting courses to stop selecting courses. 

After the conditions for the number of credits are met, the KRS will be printed on the screen and the program will stop. On the other hand, if the conditions for the number of credits are not met, an error message will be printed and the program will return to the main menu.
